    <h1>Images and Form Elements</h1>

    <h2 class="task-head">Task 1</h2>
    <p class="task-description">
        In this task, you have an image that is overflowing the box. We want the image to scale down to fit inside the
        box without any extra white space, but we do not mind if some part of the image is cropped.
    </p>

    <div class="box-one">
        <img src="imgs/balloons.jpg" alt="balloons">
    </div>



    <h2 class="task-head">Task 2</h2>
    <p class="task-description">In this task, you have a simple form. Your task is to make the following changes:
    <ul>
        <li>Use attribute selectors to target the search field and button inside .myform.</li>

        <li>Make the form field and button use the same text size as the rest of the form.</li>

        <li>Give the form field and button 10 px of padding.</li>

        <li>Give the button a background of rebeccapurple, white foreground, no border and rounded corners of 5px.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <form method="post" action="" class="myform">
        <div>
            <label for="fldSearch">Keywords</label>
            <input type="search" id="fldSearch" name="keywords">
            <input type="submit" name="btnSubmit" value="Search">
        </div>
    </form>





    <h2 class="task-head">Task 3</h2>
    <p class="task-description">One image is smaller than the box, the other is larger and breaking out of the box. If
        you imagine that the box is responsive and therefore could grow and shrink, which property would you apply to
        the image so that the large image shrinks down into the box but the small image does not stretch.</p>
