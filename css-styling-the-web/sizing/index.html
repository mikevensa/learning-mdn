  <h1>Sizing</h1>

  <h2 class="task-head">Task 1</h2>
  <p class="task-description">In this task, you have two boxes. The first should be sized so that the height will be at least 100 pixels tall, even if there is less content that would cause it to grow to that height. However, the content should not overflow if there is more content than fits in 100 pixels. Test this box by removing the content from the HTML to make sure you still get a 100 pixel tall box even with no content.
    <br>
    <br>  
  The second box should be fixed at 100 pixels tall, so that content will overflow if there is too much.
    
    </p>

  <div class="box-one box1-one">
    <p>Veggies </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="box-one box2-one">

  <h2 class="task-head">Task 2</h2>
  <p class="task-description"> Made the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box.</p>

  <div class="box-two">
    <div class="inner">Make me 60% of my parent's width.</div>
  </div>
      
    


  <h2 class="task-head">Task 3</h2>
  <p class="task-description">One image is smaller than the box, the other is larger and breaking out of the box. If you imagine that the box is responsive and therefore could grow and shrink, which property would you apply to the image so that the large image shrinks down into the box but the small image does not stretch.</p>
