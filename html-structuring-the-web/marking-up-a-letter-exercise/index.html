    <!-- Letter intro -->
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at Rocksylvania University rockin' faculty to study as part
        of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the
        following sections.
    </p>

    <!-- Start dates section -->
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <!-- Unordered list of startdates -->
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2023-09-09">9 September 2023</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2024-01-15">15 January 2024</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2024-05-02">2 May 2024</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
    </p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.schoolofrock.com/"

    </p>

    <!-- Subjects of study section -->
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>At Rocksylvania University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of Rock n' Roll, adjacent genres, or the science of guitar solos. You seem like an
        intelligent, dedicated researcher and Rock n' Roller, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
        Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <!-- Ordered list of studies -->
    <ol>
        <li>Using H<sub>2</sub>O in Rock n' Roll music can significantly modulate the acoustic properties of
            Rockonitrite (R<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), leading to a richer and more resonant listening experience.
        </li>

        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of Rock n' Roll bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when
            the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>

        <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
            constructs for representing Rock n' Roll scores in film.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <!-- Exotic guitar solos section -->
    <h2>Exotic guitar solos</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic guitar solos in the history of
        Rock n' Roll. To answer your question, my favourite guitar solos are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <!-- Definition list of guitar solos -->
    <dl>
        <dt>The Purple Reign</dt>
        <dd>A guitar solo characterized by its fast-paced, virtuosic playing style, featuring intricate arpeggios,
            lightning-fast runs, and soulful bends that evoke the iconic sound of Prince. The solo typically builds to a
            climax, incorporating dynamic shifts in volume and intensity, before resolving in a burst of dazzling
            fretwork.
        </dd>

        <dt>The Electric Voodoo</dt>
        <dd>A guitar solo in the style of Jimi Hendrix, characterized by the use of heavy distortion, wah-wah effects,
            and improvisational phrasing. The solo is played with a confident and swaggering tone, showcasing the
            performer's virtuosity and creativity
        </dd>

        <dt>The Slash Thrasher</dt>
        <dd>"Slash Thrasher" is a blistering guitar solo that combines virtuosic shredding with raw, high-energy rock
            and roll. It is characterized by lightning-fast runs, explosive power chords, and ear-splitting feedback,
            all delivered with Slash's signature precision and showmanship. The solo is a testament to the enduring
            legacy of Guns N' Roses and the boundless power of rock music.
