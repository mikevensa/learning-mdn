    <p>Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html"
            target="_blank"><cite>Confucius' quotes
                site</cite></a> says:</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html">
        <p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p>
    </blockquote>


    <p>I also love the concept of positive thinking, and <q
            cite="http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking">The Need To Eliminate
            Negative Self
            Talk</q> (as
        mentioned in <a href="http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking" target="_blank"><cite>Affirmations
